      Hello, my name is Ibrahim Ali. I am majoring in Computer Science, and so
      far its been great. This is my final year at Mesa college. I'm taking this
      course because I've already finished all my lower division transfer
      requirements. So, taking an extra computer class wouldnt't hurt. I enjoy
      making websites and wanted a little refresher on the basics of HTML and
      CSS.

      I have a solid understanding of object oriented programming and posses the
      critical thinking needed to write useful code. I have a basic
      understanding of Ruby and have taken a class on website building using
      Ruby on Rails. I also have a good understanding of React and React native.

      I am currently building an e-commerce mobile app using React Native and
      Nodejs for the backend API. I have a basic understanding of databases,
      such as SQL and Supabase. My skills with Git and GitHub are put to the
      test daily with my current project.
